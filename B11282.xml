         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O long (righte Gentle and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader) as wee liue heere in this wretched vale of miserie, and myserable estate of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationership, we are all euen the best of vs all, to account no better of our selues, then that we liue in a perpetuall warrefare, and most dangerous and deadlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</p>
            <p>Our Enimies that we are to fight against are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber three: The world, the Flesh, and the Dyuell:<note place="margin">The three dedlie eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note> two wherof notwithstanding (such is our blinde perseuerance) the moste parte esteeme their entire friends, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are the hande-mynisters of our Archenimie, all vnder colourable frendship deceiuing their familiars, and seeking their death both of bodie and soule.</p>
            <p>Our graund foeman Sathan Architect of all mischiefe, in scripture hath many proper names,<note place="margin">Reuel. 9.11.</note> to explaine his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious nature: Of his crueltie hee is called <hi>Abaddon,</hi> a Destroier, bicause that not like a common enimie hee is contented with the death and downefall of our bodies, but imagineth vtter destruction of the soule also, and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable tormentes ioyntlie to them both:<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.6.</note> Of his crafte hee is tearmed a Theefe, bicause he inuenteth by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he may slilie and vnwittinglie set vpon the godlie.<note place="margin">Iob. 1.10. and 2.5.</note> Of his malice he is called <hi>Diabolus,</hi> an accuser, bicause euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more day and night he is busie, accusing the consciences of the righteous.</p>
            <p>He is named a Dragon of his pollicie, bicause that since
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177241:3"/> the time of <hi>Adam,</hi> among so many thousands, in so many yeares, there hath beene founde none so wise or warie, that could withstand his stratagems, but he hath wounded and poisoned them well nighe vnto death.</p>
            <p>He hight a Lion also of his power, bicause that as the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide bodie of the Lion is powerfull: so especiallie consisteth great strengthe and power in his taile.</p>
            <p>We doubt not but this aduersarie, or <hi>Apollyon</hi> of ours of himselfe is mightie, puissant, &amp; strong enough againste such faintie cowards, and wilfull slo-backs as we are, yet to make his victorie more sure, and not to faile of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he vseth also the force of his tayle: that is, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thraled bondslaues, whom he hath sealed to execute his wil and pleasure vppon the harmelesse, which is perfourmed many times diuers and sundry waies: neyther dooth he so vsually shew his pollicie, puissance and power by anye his oficers, as he dooth by subtle seedemen of false doctrine, and inchanting sorcerers: the one in stead of instruments to inueigle the mind and soule, the other to assaile the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodie, and beguile and intrappe the sences.</p>
            <p>I speake nothing of those pseudosedmen, but I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (God willing) to treat of damnable Wytches, of their spight and spelles, odious in the sight of God, detested of the good, and moste hurtfull to themselues, manifesting what power and preminence through Gods permission, that Father of sinne Sathan hath ouer sinfull worldlings.</p>
            <p>About Shrouetide last, one <hi>Richard Burt,</hi> seruant to a Gentleman, named M. <hi>Edling,</hi> dwelling at <hi>Woodhall</hi> in the parishe of <hi>Pinner</hi> in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> a myle beyond <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> on the <hi>Hill,</hi> going to his maysters Barne, standing at the Townes ende, accompanied with a great mastiue dogge, suddenly espied an Hare start before him, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to haue set his dogge at her, missed of his purpose: for the dogge not onely refused to follow, but in stead of follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing began to faint, and runne rounde about his maister,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177241:3"/> and to whine pittifully, as who shoulde say that kinde of game was not for them: The man taking heartie grace himselfe, followed so nighe, that he saw her take in at one Mother <hi>Atkyns</hi> house, whome before that time he knew to be a notorious witch: Wherevpon blessing himselfe, &amp; mindful of the name of God, he boldly said, auant witch.</p>
            <p>This was the first occasion (namely the tearming of hir a with) of al poore <hi>Richard Burts</hi> future tragedie:<note place="margin">Vnspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the malice of a wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> but to go forward. It hapned the said <hi>Richard Burt</hi> a month after, méeting hir néere to his maisters barne, and giuing hir the time of the daye, like a peruerse woman, like a perillous waspe, like a pestiferous witch, incensed with hate at the sight of him held downe hir head, not daigning to speake.</p>
            <p>The next day which was on wednesday the 8. of march going againe to his maisters barne to thrash, &amp; serue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beasts, bicause he would not trudge too and fro for letting his work, carried his dinner with him, which was bread, butter, cheese and applepy, &amp; a bottle of the best béer: being come to the barne he laide his prouision, and setled close to his busines, labouring hard til twelue of the clock, at which time hunger assailing and custome preuailing, he went to dinner, wherin he had not long continued, but ther was opposite to his view a monstrous blacke Cat among the straw, which began to shake the strawe, and to make a wad thereof. The fellow being agast start vp with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plepie in his hande (for it had byn pittie a poore hungrie thresher should haue lost so good a repast) suddenly hearing a voice that commanded him, come away: Away quod he, whither shal <hi>I</hi> come? The spirit answering againe, sayde: Come and leaue thy vittels behind thée and thy knife also. Poore simplicity keeping his applepy stil in his hand, came to the barne dore, where suddenly hee was hoised vp into the aire, and carried ouer many fields, by the way espyeng his mai. plow a plowing, but not able to cal vnto them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he séemed to haue his memorie most perfect: thence passing ouer to Harrow, where on the side of the hill there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177241:4"/> is a greate ponde was drawne thrugh it, &amp; ther left his hat which was a token of that torture) because he could stay in no place, but was violentlie rapt vp the hiil, and ouer the tops of the trees at Harrow Church, so farre he absolutelie remembreth, but being haled further, he was taken (as he seemeth) into a place which was all fire, where was heard such lamentable howling and dolefull crieng, as if all the damned fiends of hell had béene tortured, and tormenten in that Limbo.</p>
            <p>You heare into how strange and passionate a place this <hi>Richard Burt</hi> was translated, now it remaineth to shewe with what Symtomes the place was furnished.</p>
            <p>First therefore (he affirmeth) it was exceeding hot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with more than Cymmerian darkenesse, plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in filthy odors and stinches, ful of noise and clamours, insomuch that hee seemed to heare infinite millions of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant noises, but saw nothing saue onelie the fire which caused such an vnquenchable drouth in his stomache, that presentlie minding a pennie hee had in his purse: looked round about for an Alehouse where he might spend it.</p>
            <p>Hearing therefore these foresaid voices, and thinking some of them had spake vnto him, he answerd sayeng, heer is no worke for me to doo: immediatlie it was reanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, coast away with him, but with this prouiso thou pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, that thou be secret, and say nothing when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most home: but he replied, and said, my maister will aske me where I haue beene: with that he was not suffered to speak any further, but his toong was doubled in his mouth, his legs burnt, hands and armes scorched, his coat pincht of his backe, and throwne into the fire, immediatly soring ouer hedges and ditches, sowsed in mire and durt, scratched with thornes and briers, so singed and disfigured, that it is both lamentable and terrible to behold him.</p>
            <p>Being brought againe to <hi>Pinner</hi> where his Mayster doth dwell, he first repaired to a ditch to drinke, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177241:4"/> in this pickle visited one of his acquaintance, whoe sometime serued <hi>M. Edling</hi> also: but whether hee sorted thither for that his friends house was nighest, or would not go home for shame that hee had béene absent foure whole daies togither, I cannot shew you: Onlie this, being sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning his maister chanced (as his custome was to passe by that way to Church at the same instant, whoe not knowing poore <hi>Richard Burt</hi> his lost sheepe, demanded of his quondam seruant if he had gotten him a man: a man sir quod he, why it is your man <hi>Richard:</hi> my man quoth the Gentlenian, that cannot bee, and therewithall beeing halfe amazed made a pause and earnestlie b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>held him, at length willing him in the name of God to tel where he had bin though he could not speake, yet hauing memory made signes and euermore pointed toward the house where mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Atkins</hi> did dwell, looking so grislie and fiercelie that waie, that he tore and rent al that came in his hands.</p>
            <p>In the meane while it was thought requisite,<note place="margin">The dutie of a good minister.</note> that the Parson of the towne named <hi>M. Smith,</hi> and mai. <hi>Burbridge</hi> of Pinner parke gentleman should be sent for, whoe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the dumbe man and pittieng his plight, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son charitably and like himselfe laboured about him, wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched open his teeth got open his mouth, indented his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vnder his toong, and with much adoo got it vnfoulded, the first wordes he spake were these: Woe worth mother <hi>Atkins,</hi> woe worth mother <hi>Atkins,</hi> for she hath bewitched me: whervpon he would not be quiet, but euer requested that he might speak with hir.</p>
            <p>Maister <hi>Burbidge</hi> and M. <hi>Smith</hi> caused hir to bee sent for, who being present, he neuer ceased til he had scratched and drawne bloud on hir, perswading himselfe that was a remedy sufficient vnder God, that would make him well: neither was it or is it any Capital error, experience testy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies: for since that he hath mended reasonablie, and nowe goeth to the Church.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:177241:5"/>
            <p>Thus haue you heard briefly the cares and crosses, that poore <hi>Richard Burt</hi> sustained (as they say) in <hi>summo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du,</hi> the eighth, the ninth, tenth and eleuenth daies of march last past, what time hee was absent from his maister the foresaid whole daies, and vsed (as ye haue heard) after the foresaid manner.</p>
            <p>Thus then leaue we <hi>Richard Burt,</hi> but with mother <hi>Atkins</hi> we must prosecute a little further.</p>
            <p>It is credibly reported in <hi>Pinner,</hi> that the saide mother <hi>Atkins</hi> on a time resorting to the house of M. <hi>Burbidge</hi> for milke (at what time the maids were busie at the dairy and not obtaining hir desire, immediatly vpon hir departure out of doores, the Creame beganne to swel and rise in the cherne,<note place="margin">Witches ar the moste vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble erraturs in the world.</note> that it burst open the top of the Cherne, and runne about the kitchen and forth at the sinke-hole, and all their huswiferie for that day went to wracke, that al was quite lost, and nothing could possiblie be well ordered. O rebels towards God: enemies to mankinde: catterpillers of a common wealth, the fire is too good to consume them.</p>
            <p>Many and sundry like actions of extreame rage and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie are imputed to her, only we will conclude, and shut vp these clauses, with this that followeth.</p>
            <p>Not long since the forenamed witch entring the groūd of one <hi>Gregorie Coulson,</hi> to craue some releefe (for she ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of almes, and good peoples charitie) she found him bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie imploied about some countrie affaires, Radling hys lambs (<hi>I</hi> thinke it was) and framing hir petition to him, because he did not straight waie leaue al and accomplish it she flung forth in a fume: But it was not longe after her departure, but he had finished his labour also, and letting forth two Lambs into a yard, suddenly they began so nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to skip and friske to and fro, that they neuer ceased af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter til they died.</p>
